## Proof-of-Concept Unexplainable ResNet-50 Model
This GitHub repo stores the code associated with [this blog post](https://ciotinga.com), which showcases a ResNet-50 model that cannot be explained by black-box saliency map generation technique RISE. A more in-depth write-up is provided in the blog post, but examples of a saliency map generated for a traditional ResNet-50 model (top) and adversarial ResNet-50 model (bottom, this repo's showcase) are shown below.
